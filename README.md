# Learning-Based Path Planning for Optimal Terrain Traversal

This repository contains the official Python implementation accompanying the paper **"Learning-Based Path Planning for Optimal Terrain Traversal using Deep Reinforcement Learning"**, designed for inclusion as supplementary material.  
The implementation provides a reproducible framework to demonstrate how a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent can learn terrain-aware navigation policies in complex two-dimensional environments.

---

## Overview

This work focuses on optimizing autonomous path planning where traversal quality matters as much as path length.  
Traditional algorithms such as A* or BFS focus solely on minimizing distance, which often leads to unstable or rough trajectories.  
In contrast, the DQN agent trained through this framework learns to balance **path optimality** and **terrain smoothness**, producing routes that are shorter in time and safer in quality.

**Figure 1:** Example qualitative comparison on a 60×60 grid.  
- **Blue path:** DQN agent’s trajectory, which follows the smooth terrain “highway.”  
- **Red path:** Traditional A* path, which is shorter in length but rougher in quality.

## Key Features

- **Custom Grid Environment**  
  The simulation environment procedurally generates 2D maps containing:
  - Static obstacles
  - Variable terrain smoothness
  - Speed breakers and uneven regions  
  This variability ensures that the learning agent experiences diverse navigation scenarios.

- **Dual-Input DQN Architecture**  
  The DQN model integrates two complementary inputs:
  1. A *local perception vector* encoding immediate surroundings (for short-term decision-making).  
  2. A *convolutional spatial map encoder* providing global awareness of terrain structure.  

  This hybrid design enables the agent to reason over both local and global spatial cues during navigation.

- **Advanced Training Strategy**  
  Training employs **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)** to ensure stable convergence.  
  Additionally, the replay buffer is pre-filled with expert demonstrations derived from a terrain-aware A* algorithm, accelerating early-stage learning and improving policy stability.

- **Benchmarking Framework**  
  The implementation includes built-in comparisons with:
  - A* (terrain-weighted and standard)
  - BFS
  - DFS  
  Performance metrics such as traversal cost, path length, and smoothness index are automatically computed.

# Learning-Based Path Planning for Optimal Terrain Traversal

This repository contains the official Python implementation accompanying the paper **"Learning-Based Path Planning for Optimal Terrain Traversal using Deep Reinforcement Learning"**.

The implementation provides a complete and reproducible framework for training a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent to navigate complex 2D grid environments.  
The agent learns to find paths that are not only short but also qualitatively superior, prioritizing smooth terrain and stable traversal over purely shortest routes.
